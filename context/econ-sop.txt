I am interested in the theory and design of learning systems that involve multiple interacting agents, with a focus on how network structure, strategic incentives, and decentralized dynamics shape collective outcomes. My work spans network economics, multi-agent systems, and the statistical foundations of machine learning. I am drawn to questions where mathematical tools from optimization, game theory, and learning theory can illuminate phenomena that arise when many agents, human or artificial, interact.
Selected Research Experiences
Network Economics and Opinion Dynamics
My senior thesis (advised by Prof. Ben Golub), which I am completing for Northwestern's Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences (MMSS) program, studies how structural balance and external information affect affective polarization in signed network models. These models are relevant for understanding phenomena like political polarization, where social media platforms create signed relationships (trust, distrust, or algorithmic amplification/suppression) and external information (news, recommendations) interacts with social updating to produce collective opinion dynamics.
The classical literature on opinion dynamics, following DeGroot, assumes agents update beliefs by averaging over their neighbors, implicitly treating all influence as cooperative. This framework is well-understood: under mild connectivity assumptions, agents converge to consensus, and the mathematics reduces to spectral analysis of row-stochastic matrices. But both Bayesian learning agents and natural social phenomena involve antagonistic relationships, where agents may oppose or actively repel from certain neighbors. A small recent literature has begun exploring this territory, introducing signed graphs with "opposing" and "repelling" update rules, but existing analyses rely on restrictive assumptions: structural balance, absolute row-stochasticity, and (when external information is present) constant signals. The result is a patchwork: we understand informationless dynamics reasonably well, and one recent paper analyzed the informational regime but only under a four-way conjunction of assumptions (structurally balanced, absolutely row-stochastic, opposing dynamics, constant signal). My thesis asks what happens outside this restrictive case. What is the long-run behavior when agents receive time-varying external information under repelling dynamics? What breaks when we relax structural balance? So far, I have been able to correct some spurious claims in the literature and generalize key lemmas relating structural balance to spectral properties. By understanding which properties of the update matrix (spectral radius conditions, summing properties) are actually doing the work in existing proofs, my goal is to characterize long-run behavior across these unexplored regimes using a general, parsimonious, and sociologically meaningful model.
Earlier in my undergraduate studies, I worked with Prof. Miklós Rácz on label propagation in the stochastic block model. Label propagation is a simple, decentralized algorithm for community detection: each node iteratively adopts the most common label among its neighbors, starting from some initial assignment. Its appeal is computational cheapness and locality, making it practical for large-scale networks where global methods are infeasible. The stochastic block model SBM(n, p, q) provides a natural testbed: n nodes are partitioned into communities, with edges appearing independently at rate p within communities and q between them. While label propagation is well-studied on Erdős-Rényi graphs, sharp phase transitions for SBMs remain open. Simulations reveal three regimes: convergence to correct labels, convergence to a single label, and failure to converge, with transitions around p or q = Θ(n^α). Prior work tightened the boundary to α > −1/3, then α > −3/8. For balanced two-community SBMs, I mapped empirical boundaries via simulation and, for the two-round case, tightened the theoretical boundary to α > −1/4 using random graph theory. This was my first exposure to a recurring theme in my research: simple local rules can produce predictable global structure, and the boundaries between qualitative behaviors are often sharp and tractable.
Multi-Agent Coordination and Routing (CMU)
This past summer at CMU's Language Technologies Institute (advised by Prof. Graham Neubig), I studied whether a learned router over a pool of language models could reduce SWE agent cost while preserving performance. We framed this as learning a value function over partial trajectories, with model choice as the action. The RL framework was simple (advantage-weighted regression), yet we observed clear gains over static baselines.
The interesting finding was implicit collaboration: individual models were unaware of the team, but the router mediated coordination where specialized models collectively outperformed any single model. This is a collective intelligence phenomenon that I think would be both mathematically interesting and practically helpful to formalize: when does heterogeneity help? Under what task structures does a diverse pool outperform the best individual? How does error correlation affect aggregation value? These are classical questions in information aggregation and team theory, now in a new setting. I'm also curious whether sequential routing offers advantages over parallel ensembling, and whether social choice theory can inform aggregation design.
Foundations of Generative Models (MAGICS Lab)
I built technical depth in ML theory through work in the MAGICS Lab. In a NeurIPS paper, I co-authored a study of diffusion transformers under the manifold hypothesis, deriving minimax-optimal sample complexity bounds with explicit dependence on intrinsic dimension. That paper justified latent diffusion architectures via a score decomposition that exploits manifold structure. In a first-author follow-up on flow-matching transformers, I asked whether an analogous decomposition existed, and if so, what the right object to decompose was. I proved a velocity decomposition theorem: under a linear latent subspace assumption, the optimal velocity splits into tangent and orthogonal components that can be learned separately. This yields a risk decoupling (the two components don't interfere during optimization) and an identifiability result (on-manifold dynamics are uniquely pinned down by data).
This work gave me fluency in approximation theory, statistical learning, and sample complexity arguments, and it made me curious about where else these questions arise: when do structural assumptions make a problem tractable, what quantities are identifiable from data, and when do local updates produce stable global behavior? These are exactly the questions I now find myself asking about collective dynamics.

Outlook
Across these projects, a recurring theme has been understanding how local dynamics aggregate into collective outcomes: when update rules produce consensus versus polarization, when heterogeneous agents outperform individuals, and what structural conditions determine these boundaries.
In graduate school, I want to work on collective intelligence broadly: how groups of agents aggregate information, form beliefs, and reach decisions. I am especially interested in two directions. First, opinion dynamics and information aggregation in networks, with an eye toward robustness to misinformation and formalizing notions of fairness or democratic consensus. Second, theory for collective intelligence in AI systems: when heterogeneous agents outperform individuals, what coordination structures help, and how mechanism design and social choice can inform multi-agent system design.
More broadly, I see ML as generating new instances of classical questions: routing is division of labor; RLHF is preference aggregation; multi-agent systems exhibit dynamics that game theory and network economics were built to analyze. I want to bring mathematical rigor to questions about how intelligent systems, human and artificial, can be designed to produce good collective outcomes. Beyond my research, I have been building familiarity with the theoretical tools this agenda requires through coursework and independent reading in game theory, social choice, and mechanism design, and through talks on topics like online learning and algorithmic collusion. These are frameworks I want to develop further and deploy in graduate school.
MIT Sloan's Information Technology group brings together researchers working on exactly the questions I care about. I am particularly excited to work with Prof. Manish Raghavan, whose work on mechanism design in algorithmic systems and the challenge of eliciting user preferences connects directly to my interests in aggregation and collective decision-making. (This past summer, I spoke with Keyon Vafa, a postdoc at Harvard, about his work on LLM world models, and he suggested Prof. Raghavan as someone whose interests overlap substantially with mine.) I am also drawn to Prof. Abdullah Almaatouq's experimental and theoretical work on collective intelligence and human-AI collaboration, including questions about when social influence helps versus hurts group accuracy, and to Prof. Sinan Aral's research on information diffusion and the structural conditions under which false information spreads. Prof. Vicky Chuqiao Yang's (in System Dynamics) dynamical systems approach to collective behavior, including her work on when social learning degrades collective performance, complements my interest in characterizing when decentralized update rules produce good outcomes. Together, these researchers exemplify the intersection of network science, mechanism design, and multi-agent theory that I want to contribute to.
Ultimately, my goal is to become a research professor. I want to pursue a PhD so that I can work on the questions I care about: how groups of agents, human and artificial, aggregate information and form beliefs; when collaboration improves collective outcomes and when it doesn't; and how to design mechanisms and systems that reliably produce good decisions. I find real joy in sharing ideas and learning from others, and I want a career that makes that exchange central.
