                        I've been skating competitively since I was five and love the combination of artistry and athleticism. I'm on The Purple Line, Northwestern's synchronized skating team, where I've found some of my best friends and had a blast skating, traveling, and competing with the team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being on the skating team has really helped me understand collective intelligence and local coordination. Synchronized skating is a fascinating example of a system where you have to coordinate with your teammates locally—as a single skater, I can only be aware of what is around me and immediately what I'm feeling from my neighbors, but all of us together have the goal as a team of skating in a particular shape or formation. The way that local, decentralized awareness aggregates into coordinated global patterns has deepened my appreciation for how distributed systems can achieve collective goals, which connects to my research interests in multi-agent systems and network dynamics.

                        I enjoy reading about mathematics, science, and history whenever I can make time for it. Some of my favorites include Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh, Shape by Jordan Ellenberg, and Chaos by James Gleick. Please let me know if you have any recommendations!

                        My dog is my constant companion and the best study buddy. Having a pet has taught me the importance of taking breaks and finding joy in simple moments. Whether it's a quick walk around the block or just sitting together while I work, their unconditional love and enthusiasm are always a mood booster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They have an uncanny ability to sense when I need a break from work, often nudging me to get up and move around. Their presence reminds me to stay present and appreciate the small moments in life.

            <p>
                Beyond these main activities, I enjoy exploring new coffee shops, listening to a wide variety of music (from classical to indie), and traveling when possible. I believe that maintaining diverse interests helps keep me creative and prevents burnout in my academic work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of these activities provides a different kind of fulfillment and helps me maintain a balanced perspective on life. They remind me that there's more to life than just work and research, while also providing inspiration and energy that I can bring back to my academic pursuits.
