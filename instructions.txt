Alright new set of instructions! First I want to flesh out the CMU project a little bit. Refer to my CV and CS SOP for more context.
Secondly for every single project I want to standardize the way I write it. Basically what this means is that I want to follow the format of the DIT project. Many of these projects are already of this format like my RIPS project is also of this format for instance. But the basic format is I should have a little bit of an informal editorial in the beginning that is kind of like a layperson's introduction to the project and also some personal notes about thanking my advisors or teammates or my personal reflections on the project stuff like, "this was my first time really exploring networks" or from my thesis project. You can say, "this was inspired by my PTSD from Twitter wars" or something like that, you know. You should ask me for these personal notes if you don't know what to put in this section. Then there should be a succinct abstract and I do mean very succinct. Like it should not be more than two paragraphs long. Two paragraphs is already very very long. Like it should be succinct so please go through and make those revisions for all of the projects.
As a general note you should try not to write things in a way that is too reminiscent of my statements. My statements and my website should ideally be complements to each other. There should not be a ton of redundancy so do try not to just copy over text verbatim or almost verbatim. This is my website. So we're allowed to be a little more informal. You know still with an academic audience in mind but a little more informal.
